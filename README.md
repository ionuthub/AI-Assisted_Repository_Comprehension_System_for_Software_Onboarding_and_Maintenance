# AI-Assisted Repository Comprehension System for Software Onboarding

BSc Computer Science dissertation artefact for *Design and Evaluation of an AI-Assisted Repository Comprehension System for Software Onboarding*.

The tool helps users understand unfamiliar JavaScript and TypeScript repositories. It accepts a public GitHub URL and provides a repository overview, import analysis, TF-IDF code search, grounded question answering, file inspection and an evidence panel.

## Scope

The evaluated scope is initial repository comprehension on desktop and laptop browsers. Mobile and tablet use, long-term maintenance and code changes are outside the evaluated scope.

| `e2e/` | End-to-end tests |
| `analysis/` | Technical evaluation scripts |
| `study/` | Final evaluation records |

## Main features

- Repository overview and technology detection
- Import-based file ranking
- Client-side TF-IDF search
- Grounded answers using retrieved repository evidence
- Evidence display with file and relevance information
- Repository coverage reporting

## Technology

React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, TF-IDF retrieval, Google Gemini and Vercel.

## Run locally

Requires Node.js 20 or 22, npm and a Gemini API key.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ionuthub/AI-Assisted_Repository_Comprehension_System_for_Software_Onboarding_and_Maintenance.git
npm install
npm run dev
```

Checks:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npx vitest run
npx playwright test
npm run build
```

## Security

The Gemini API key stays server-side. The API checks allowed origins, request size and context size. Rate limiting works only when Upstash Redis is configured.

## AI use

AI tools were used during development, testing, analysis, review and writing support. Details are recorded in [`study/AI-DISCLOSURE.md`](study/AI-DISCLOSURE.md).

The researcher remains responsible for the final scope, marking decisions, interpretation and submitted work.
