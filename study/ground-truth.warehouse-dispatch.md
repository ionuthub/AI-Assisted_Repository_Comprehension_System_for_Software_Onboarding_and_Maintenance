# Reference answers — warehouse-dispatch

These are the required answers used for the final 24-question accuracy evaluation.

## Q1 — orientation

> Where does execution start in this project?

Browser execution starts in `src/main.tsx`, which finds the `root` element and renders `App`
inside React strict mode. The router is not created by `App`: it is built once at module scope
when `App.tsx` is first imported. `App` itself installs the notification listeners, calls the
store's `initialize`, and renders the `RouterProvider` around the router that already exists.

**Files:** src/main.tsx:1-10, src/App.tsx:11-22, src/App.tsx:24-31

## Q2 — config-driven behaviour

> How is an order assigned to a warehouse zone?

`allocateOrder` processes each order line independently. It scores every zone with `scoreZone`,
removes inactive zones and zones without the SKU, sorts by descending score, and proposes
allocations from available stock until the requested quantity is covered. `scoreZone` applies
configuration rules in priority order: hazardous isolation, cold-chain compatibility,
order-type routing, and capacity balance. `applyStockReservation` then accepts only quantities
still available and updates reserved stock in a cloned zone set.

**Files:** src/dispatch/allocator.ts:17-73, src/config/zoneRules.ts:14-19, src/config/zoneRules.ts:28-85, src/stock/reservation.ts:9-45

## Q3 — handler registry

> Which code decides how a given order type is processed?

The dispatch-handler registry makes the decision. On first use, `getHandler` dynamically imports
every handler module; each module registers one handler keyed by its `type`. Allocation and
release look up the handler using `order.type`, then call its preparation/inspection or
shipment-default methods.

**Files:** src/dispatch/handlers/registry.ts:3-32, src/dispatch/handlers/standardHandler.ts:1-22, src/dispatch/handlers/expressHandler.ts:1-31, src/dispatch/handlers/bulkHandler.ts:1-37, src/dispatch/handlers/hazardousHandler.ts:1-27, src/dispatch/allocator.ts:21, src/dispatch/releaseService.ts:17

## Q4 — cross-cutting concern

> Everywhere stock is reserved — list every place it happens.

Actual reservation changes are centralized in `applyStockReservation`. It is called during
initial allocation, again before shipment release to recheck and finalize the order's
allocations, and by the periodic revalidation job after resetting reserved counts and
rebuilding them for active orders. The store installs that revalidation job during
initialization.

**Files:** src/stock/reservation.ts:9-45, src/dispatch/allocator.ts:56-72, src/dispatch/releaseService.ts:31, src/jobs/revalidation.ts:10-49, src/store/useWarehouseStore.ts:88-125

## Q5 — interceptor chain

> What happens to an outgoing API request before it is sent?

The client builds a request with an `Accept` header and empty metadata, then applies three
interceptors in order. Authentication adds the bearer token; audit adds a request timestamp,
source, and correlation ID; and the hazardous interceptor conditionally rewrites `/orders` to
`/controlled/orders`, adds an `x-controlled-load` header and sets `routing` metadata to
`dangerous-goods`. The transformed request is then passed to the mock transport.

## Q6 — misleading name

> Does `validateShipment` change any state, or does it only check?

It does more than check. Alongside collecting errors and warnings, it mutates the supplied
shipment by assigning `shipment.dock`: hazardous orders always receive D4; other orders receive
D1–D3 deterministically from the order ID.

**Files:** src/dispatch/validation.ts:12-40

## Q7 — legacy path

> Which pricing implementation runs for a bulk order, and why that one?

Bulk orders use `calculateLegacyPrice`. `pricingByType` maps `bulk` to `legacy`;
`calculateOrderPrice` reads that strategy and delegates to the legacy implementation. The legacy
calculation adds per-pallet handling and applies tiered volume discounts.

**Files:** src/config/zoneRules.ts:21-26, src/config/zoneRules.ts:76-78, src/pricing/pricing.ts:1-8, src/pricing/legacyPricing.ts:3-21

## Q8 — event emitter

> What reacts when a dispatch event is emitted?

Reactions depend on the event. `shipment.released` is consumed by the notification listener,
which publishes a success notification. `stock.low` is consumed both by that notification
listener and by the stock service's in-memory low-stock signal collector. There is no
registered listener for `order.allocated` or `notification.created` in this repository.

**Files:** src/events/bus.ts:3-34, src/notifications/listener.ts:4-23, src/stock/stockService.ts:6-9, src/dispatch/allocator.ts:71, src/dispatch/releaseService.ts:57, src/stock/stockService.ts:16-37, src/stock/stockService.ts:4, src/stock/stockService.ts:39-41, src/notifications/service.ts:16

## Q9 — applied

> Where would a new order type be added, and what else would need changing?

Add the literal to `OrderType`; add entries to both exhaustive order-type maps for zone
preferences and pricing; and add a handler module that calls `registerHandler` with preparation,
inspection, and shipment defaults. The dynamically loaded registry will discover the new handler
automatically. Seed and UI fixtures and tests should also be extended if the new type must
appear and be verified.

## Q10 — applied

> If the zone rules changed, what else would be affected?

Changes to matching, compatible zone kinds, priorities, or preference scores alter which zones
are ranked and therefore each order's proposed and accepted allocations, shortage warnings,
final `allocated` versus `held` state, and reserved stock totals. Revalidation and release reuse
those stored allocations and reservations. If the order-type pricing map in the same
configuration file changes, the calculated order total also changes.

## Q11 — interceptor chain

> Are hazardous orders treated differently anywhere? Where?

Yes. Their handler adds dangerous-goods paperwork, raises priority, validates regulated lines
and international review, and supplies SecureChem shipment defaults. Zone scoring isolates a
hazardous order or line to secure zones. The API interceptor rewrites outgoing hazardous-order
requests and adds controlled-load metadata. Shipment validation requires SecureChem and forces
dock D4. Current pricing also adds a hazardous fee when a line is hazardous.

**Files:** src/dispatch/handlers/hazardousHandler.ts:3-27, src/config/zoneRules.ts:14-19, src/config/zoneRules.ts:30-36, src/api/interceptors/hazardous-interceptor.ts:4-13, src/dispatch/validation.ts:29-30, src/pricing/pricing.ts:16-20

## Q12 — misleading name

> Where is a dock assigned to a shipment?

`validateShipment` assigns the dock directly on the mutable shipment object. It chooses D4 for
hazardous orders and otherwise D1–D3 from a checksum of the order ID. `releaseShipment` calls
that function and then copies the resulting dock to `releasedOrder.assignedDock`.
